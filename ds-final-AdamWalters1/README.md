# Data Science Final Project

## Introduction

THIS PROJECT IS TO BE DONE INDIVIDUALLY. ALL WORK MUST BE YOUR OWN. FAILURE TO DO SO WILL RESULT IN A GRADE OF ZERO FOR THE PROJECT AND A VIOLATION OF THE GSST HONOR CODE.

This project is the final project for the Data Science portion of the course.

You can choose to do one of the following for your project:

1. **Collect Your Own Data**: You can collect your own data and perform an analysis on it. This can be data can come from anywhere. If you are surveying people, you must anonymise the data. You ***MUST*** have a minimum of 50 records of data with at least 5 variables.

2. **Analyze an Existing Dataset:** You can analyze an existing dataset. This dataset can come from anywhere, but you must be able to provide the dataset to me. You ***MUST*** have a minimum of 200 records of data with at least 7 variables. You will need to submit your dataset to me prior to the due date (see dates below). *You are not allowed to use the same dataset as someone else in the class.* Once you have found your dataset and are ready to submit it, please email me the dataset or provide a link to the dataset in an email, and I will confirm that you can use it. ***I recommend you do this as soon as possible.***

## Note on Commits

You must commit your work to your GitHub repository to receive credit for the following items below. At the end of your project you must have at least 10 commits. Failure to do so will result a loss of points.

## Requirements

1. Proposal (Due: **Friday, May 10 at 11:59 PM**)
   - A description of the data you will be using.
     - If you are collecting your own data, you must provide a description of the data you plan to collect.
     - If you are using an existing dataset, you must provide a description of the dataset and a link to it/citation (APA format).
   - A description of the variables in the data. (If you are collecting your own data, you must provide a description of the variables you plan to collect.)
   - A description of the analysis you plan to do.
   - A description of the visualizations you plan to create.
   - Label your proposal as `PROPOSAL.md` within your GitHub repository.
   - Your proposal must be at least 500 words long. Display the number of words at the end of your proposal. Your report may be anonymously, randomly checked for a word count.
  
1. Analysis (Due: **Wednesday, May 15 at 11:59 PM**)
   - You must perform a comprehensive analysis of the data. This analysis should include the following:
   - Univariate statistics (means, medians, standard deviations, etc.)
   - Bivariate statistics (correlations, t-tests, etc.)
   - Regression (linear, logistic, etc.)
   - K-means clustering
   - MDS (Multi-dimensional scaling) or PCA (Principal Component Analysis) plot.
   - 2 additional plots of your choice that contribute to the insights you receive from the data.
   - ***NOTE***: Part of the grade for your graphs is the quality and aesthetics of the graphs. Make sure your graphs are clear, easy to read, and well-labeled. Plain graphs, gray-scale graphs, or graphs with poor labeling will lose points.
   - You can use Python, R, or Julia to perform your analysis. R can be done in R Markdown or Jupyter Notebook. Python and Julia must be done in a Jupyter notebook.
   - Label your analysis as `ANALYSIS.ipynb` or `ANALYSIS.Rmd` within your GitHub repository.

2. Report of analysis (Due: **Friday, May 17 at 11:59 PM**)

   - You must submit a report of your analysis. This report should include the following:
   - A description of the data you used.
   - A description of the variables in the data.
   - A description of the analysis you did.
   - A description of the visualizations you created.
   - The visualizations you created. Yes, I do mean the actual visualizations. You must include the visualizations in your report (not the code for them, that is in your Jupyter notebook or R Markdown file).
   - A description of the results of your analysis.
     - Your analysis must include a discussion of the results of your analysis. You must interpret the results of your analysis. The insights you receive ***MUST*** be meaningful to the data you are analyzing.
   - Label your report as `REPORT.md` within your GitHub repository. ***Your report is separate from your Jupyter notebook or R Markdown file.***
   - Your report must be at least 800 words long. Display the number of words at the end of your report. Your report may be anonymously, randomly checked for a word count.
  
3. Presentation (Due **Sunday, May 19 at 11:59 PM**)
   - DO NOT SUBMIT YOUR PRESENTATION TO GITHUB. THERE WILL BE A CANVAS ASSIGNMENT TO SUBMIT TO.  YOU WILL PRESENT THIS IN CLASS.
      - DO NOT SUBMIT YOUR PRESENTATION TO GITHUB. THERE WILL BE A CANVAS ASSIGNMENT TO SUBMIT TO.  YOU WILL PRESENT THIS IN CLASS.
   - You must present your analysis to the class. This presentation should be 5-8 minutes long. You can use any presentation tool you want (e.g., PowerPoint, Google Slides, etc.). You will present your analysis on **Monday, May 20**, or if there is not enough time **Tuesday, May 21**.
