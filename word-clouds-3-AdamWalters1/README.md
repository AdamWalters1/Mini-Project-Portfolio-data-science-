# Dealing with Word Clouds in R

## Introduction

This assignment is a continuation of the word cloud assignments that we have been doing. We will now perform the analysis we did on `corpS`, on `corpG`.

## Problems/Questions

1. Clean `corpG`
2. Create a term-by-document matrix from `corpG`.
3. Transform the term-by-document matrix so that you can
4. use the functions `wordcloud()` to create word clouds for `corpG`. You must create at least 1 **colored** word cloud, one for each of the following:

   - `corpG` with no stopwords
   - `corpG` with stopwords

5. Compare the word clouds for `corpG` and `corpS`. What are the differences? What are the similarities? What do you think is the reason for these differences and similarities?
6. What impressions do you have about the class looking at the word cloud for `corpG`? What about `corpS`? What do you think is the reason for these impressions?
	- *Hint*: Take a look at the dictionary part of the `strengths` and `gains` questions in the dataset.
