## R Data Analysis Project, Adam Walters, Alexander Grant, Sara Fernandez

## Survey
Our group collectively decided on the topic of music for our survey. (SEE ACTION PLAN)
We asked 10 questions, 6 numeric and 4 non-numeric: 

What is your gender? (options: Male, Female, Prefer not to say)

What is your strand? (options: Biochem, Comp Sci, Engineering)

Which of these Genres do you listen to the most? (options: Rap, Jazz, Pop, R&B, Metal, Lofi, Classical)

What music apps do you use? (options: Apple Music, Spotify, Other)

How often do you listen to music from a language that you don't speak? (Scale 0 to 100: 0 being never, 100 being that's the only music you listen to)

How often do you listen to music? (Scale 0 to 100: 0 being never, 100 being whenever you possibly can)

How important are lyric to you when you listen to music? (Scale of 0 to 100: 0 being not at all, 100 being very extremely important)

How much do you think music affects your mood and productivity (Scale of 0 to 100: 0 being not at all, 100 being significantly)

How excited would you be to go to a concert? (Scale of 0 to 100: 0 being not at all, 100  being significantly)

Approximately how many hours per week do you spend listening to music?

## Hypothesis
We then made some hypothese, predicting trends within the data:

The majority of Comp Sci students are music oriented.

Those who listen to music more often will have a stronger effect on their mood and personality.

The most popular genre will have similar rates of importance.

Males will be more likely to listen to rap music.

Those who use music apps besides Apple Music and Spotify are more likely to listen to music from other languages and find lyrics less important.

## Analysis
After acuiring 30 responses from a mix of juniors and seniors, and getting a roughly even split of strands, we closed the survey and cleaned the data. (SEE MusicSurveyDataUpdated)

After importing the data into rstudio, We conducted data analysis, including summary data, Kmean algorithms, and other visualizations in order to see any trends within the data. We tested the 5 hypotheses. Also conducted hypothesis tests.
